## Insurance Cost Analysis

This repository contains my work on a **Coursera Practice Project** analyzing insurance cost data using **Python**. The focus is on **cleaning raw data**, performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and understanding how key factors influence insurance charges.

The project builds **Linear Regression** models (single and multi-variable) and refines them using **Ridge Regression** to improve prediction performance. The analysis is implemented using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**
